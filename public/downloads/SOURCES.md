# Source list

Every factual claim in the report cites one of these sources as S1, S2 and so on. Under each source are the exact words the report relies on. Text snapshots of every page, with capture time and SHA-256, are in `evidence/` (see `evidence/manifest.json`).

**S1. Redbelly DAO Task Board**: TASK-29 brief: Quant Overledger and Redbelly Interoperability Research  
https://taskboard.redbellydao.network/tasks/TASK-29

- "This is feasibility research only. Redbelly and Quant have no announced partnership or talks"
- "Redbelly has not published an official position on bridging"

**S2. Vine, Redbelly Network developer portal**: EVM compatibility and version details  
https://vine.redbelly.network/consensus/evm-compatibility/

- "Redbelly is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can execute smart contracts written for the EVM."

**S3. Quant, Overledger documentation**: Chapter 5: Connectors  
https://docs.overledger.dev/docs/connectors

- "Six DLT families are available for self-serve onboarding today, you can register a node and call the network without an account-team conversation"
- "Covers every EVM-compatible chain"
- "A DLT family is considered eligible for self-serve if (a) its nodes expose RPC or REST over HTTPS, (b) the RPC requires no security factor beyond an API key, and (c) node identity does not matter to other tenants (so a pool of equivalent nodes can be load-balanced safely)."
- "New network within a supported DLT family, the network is not yet listed by Overledger, but its DLT family is one Overledger already supports for self-serve (EVM, Solana, Cosmos, SUI, Hedera, Aptos). The first POST /nodes call registers both the network and your node for it. This new network will then be available for Overledger users."
- "If public is selected then the user can only add nodes from whitelisted providers. If private is selected then the user can add nodes from any domain."
- "alchemy.com, infura.io, quiknode.pro, chainstack.com, getblock.io, blockdaemon.com, ankr.com"
- "Required, embedded in the URL path (the Gateway forwards the URL as-is), not a header."
- "Any reachable HTTPS URL, self-hosted, custom-provider, on your own infrastructure, anywhere."
- "The Gateway runs a health check using the DLT's standard validation from section 5.1 and, on success, adds the node to the network's load-balancing pool."
- "For networks where node identity matters, typically permissioned DLTs used by regulated consortia and operator-gated public chains, Overledger does not self-serve currently."
- "Implement a DLT checker (health validation + chain identifer lookup) ~2 days"
- "Add per-DLT handling in any apps that need to consume it ~1 day per app"
- "Forwards the payload, returns the native response unchanged."
- "Self-serve Connectors for public, permissionless DLT families."
- "For networks where it does not matter which node a client connects to, i.e. public permissionless networks"
- "Hyperledger Besu (permissioned) Permissioned EVM Used in regulated EVM deployments."
- "Run GET /networks to retrieve the live list."
- "For networks where it does not matter which node a client connects to, i.e. public permissionless networks, Quant Connect lets you register a managed-provider node URL via a single UI form and Overledger lets you register a managed-provider node URL via a single API call. The network then becomes immediately reachable through the Overledger Gateway."
- "Any tenant with access to the network, the node joins the shared load-balancing pool for that network."
- "the node is scoped to your user identity"
- "DLTs that need consortium membership, MSP enrolment, channel agreement, notary trust, privacy-group setup, or any other identity-bound configuration are onboarded through the engagement path"

- "Compute Fusion Rollup state roots and post them to all connected DLT networks for settlement"
- "Because Fusion is an optimistic rollup, a withdrawal is not immediately final, there is a dispute window during which a challenger can prove the Fusion Rollup state root invalid."
- "Fusion can map several token contracts to a single rollup-side ERC-20, so deposits from any of those source chains land in one unified balance."
